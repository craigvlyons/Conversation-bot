Test Result: PASS

============================================================
RECOMMENDATION:
============================================================
1. Your production Azure DevOps server IS working correctly
2. It uses SSE transport (visible in your program logs)
3. For tool discovery testing, temporarily stop your production
   server and run: python azure_devops_server.py
4. Then run: python test_tool_discovery.py
5. You should see full tool discovery working!
