"""
MCP Tooling for Convo Bot Agent
This module provides integration points for Multi-Channel Provider (MCP) tools, such as Playwright MCP,
for use by the agent or UI. Extend this file with MCP automation, browser, or app control logic as needed.
"""

# Example: Playwright MCP integration stub
# (Install dependencies: pip install playwright-mcp-client)

# from playwright_mcp_client import MCPClient
# import asyncio

# async def get_page_title(url: str) -> str:
#     async with MCPClient("ws://localhost:8080") as mcp:
#         browser = await mcp.chromium.launch()
#         page = await browser.new_page()
#         await page.goto(url)
#         title = await page.title()
#         await browser.close()
#         return title

# Add more MCP-related tooling and utilities below as needed for your agent.
